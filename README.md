# Opencart Automation Framework

## Overview

This project is a Selenium-based automation framework developed in Java using TestNG. It is designed for testing the Opencart e-commerce platform and follows a data-driven testing approach. The framework is modular, scalable, and integrates with TestNG for test execution and reporting.

## Features

* **Selenium WebDriver Integration**: Automates browser interactions for end-to-end testing.
* **TestNG Framework**: Manages test execution, grouping, and reporting.
* **Data-Driven Testing**: Utilizes external data sources (e.g., Excel files) for test inputs.
* **Cross-Browser Testing**: Configurable to run tests on multiple browsers.
* **Modular Design**: Organized codebase for maintainability and scalability.
* **Logging and Reporting**: Generates detailed logs and test reports for analysis.

## Prerequisites

* **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher
* **Apache Maven**: For project build and dependency management
* **Eclipse IDE**: Recommended for development (optional)
* **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, etc., for test execution

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raki1929/Opencart.git
   ```

2. **Import Project into Eclipse**:

   * Open Eclipse.
   * Go to `File` > `Import` > `Existing Maven Projects`.
   * Select the cloned repository folder.

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   * Open a terminal in the project directory.
   * Run the following command to download dependencies:

     ```bash
     mvn clean install
     ```

## Test Execution

### Using TestNG Suite

* **Default Suite**:

  * Open `testng.xml`.
  * Right-click and select `Run As` > `TestNG Suite`.

* **Cross-Browser Testing**:

  * Open `crossbrowsertesting.xml`.
  * Configure desired browsers in the XML file.
  * Run as TestNG Suite.

* **Grouped Tests**:

  * Open `grouping.xml`.
  * Define test groups as needed.
  * Run as TestNG Suite.

### Using Maven

* Execute tests using Maven:

  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```

## Test Data Management

* Test data is stored in the `testData/` directory.
* Ensure that the data files (e.g., Excel sheets) are properly formatted.
* The framework reads data from these files during test execution.

## Reporting

* TestNG generates reports in the `test-output/` directory.
* Open `index.html` in a browser to view the test execution report.

## Logging

* Logs are generated in the `logs/` directory.
* Review these logs for debugging and analysis purposes.
